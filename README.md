# Relworx_Money

Nemwel Relworx Money is a Single Page application that aims to showcase how transactions can be handled in the client side. The application allows users to create accounts, sign in to their accounts and depending on their rights (admin/ user) they can be able to topup or send money to other valid users in the application.


The project makes use of the browser local storage as its database. When the page loads for the first time in a users browser, an admin user called Nemwel Boniface is created and his details is stored in the users browser local storage. The project is hosted on GitHub and is deployed by Netlify. 

To plan my tasks, I created a [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/Nemwel-Boniface/projects/2) where I prioritized and broke the project requirements into small doable chunks of tasks.


The project requirements were as follows:

1. Users can create an account and log in.
2. Admin can top up money onto a user‚Äôs wallet.
3. Users can send the money deposited onto their account to another user.
4. Users can receive money from another user
5. Users can check their new balance

There were constraints as to how the project was supposed to be created:

1. Do NOT download or use an already built website template.
2. Do NOT use any CSS libraries/frameworks e.g Bootstrap or Materialize.
3. Do NOT use frameworks or libraries like JQuery, Angular, Vue or React.
4. Use only html , css and javascript to build the prototype.
5. Don't build any back end for the prototype , use dummy data or your
browser local storage where necessary.
6. Deploy the project


Enjoy!
